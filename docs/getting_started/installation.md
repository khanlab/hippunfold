# Installation

BIDS App for Hippocampal AutoTop (automated hippocampal unfolding and
subfield segmentation)

## Requirements

-   Docker (Intel Mac/Windows/Linux) or Singularity (Linux)
-   For those wishing to contribute or modify the code, `pip install` or `poetry install` are also available (Linux), but will still require singularity to handle some dependencies. See [Contributing to HippUnfold](https://hippunfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/contributing.html).
-   GPU not required
-   Note: Apple M1 is currently **not supported**. We don't have a Docker arm64 container yet, and hippunfold is unusably slow with the emulated amd64 container. 

### Notes:

-   Inputs to Hippunfold should typically be a BIDS dataset including T1w images or T2w images. Higher-resolution data are preferred (\<= 0.8mm) but the pipeline will still work with 1mm T1w images. See [Tutorials](https://hippunfold.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/standardBIDS.html).
-   Other 3D imaging modalities (eg. ex-vivo MRI, 3D histology, etc.) can be used, but may require manual tissue segmentation as the current workflow relies on U-net segmentation trained only on common MRI modalities.


## Comparison of methods for running HippUnfold

There are several different ways of running HippUnfold. In order of increasing complexity/flexibility, we have:

1. CBRAIN Web-based Platform
2. Singularity Container on Linux
3. Docker Container on Windows/Mac (Intel)/Linux
4. Python Environment with Singularity Dependencies

### CBRAIN Web-based Platform

HippUnfold is available on the [CBRAIN platform](https://github.com/aces/cbrain/wiki), a 
web-based platform for batch high-performance computing that is free for researchers.

#### Pros:
- No software installation required
- Fully point and click interface (no CLI)
- Can perform batch-processing

#### Cons:
- Must upload data for processing
- Limited command-line options exposed
- Cannot edit code


### Docker on Windows/Mac (Intel)/Linux

The HippUnfold BIDS App is available on a DockerHub as versioned releases and development branches.

#### Pros:
- Compatible with non-Linux systems 
- All dependencies+models in a single container

#### Cons:
- Typically not possible on shared machines
- Cannot use Snakemake cluster execution profiles
- Cannot edit code

### Singularity Container

The same docker container can also be used with Singularity (now Apptainer). Instructions can be found below.

#### Pros:
- All dependencies+models in a single container
- Container stored as a single file (.sif)

#### Cons:
- Compatible on shared systems with Singularity installed
- Cannot use Snakemake cluster execution profiles
- Cannot edit code


### Python Environment with Singularity Dependencies

Instructions for this can be found in the **Contributing** documentation page.

#### Pros:
- Complete flexibility to modify code
- External (Non-Python) dependencies as Singularity containers

#### Cons:
- Must use Python virtual environment
- Only compatible on Linux systems with Singularity for external dependencies
