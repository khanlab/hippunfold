This workflow generates a set of custom density unfolded templates, with adaptive spacing designed to result in (mostly) constant surface area when transformed to native space



Requirements:
  - https://github.com/gllmflndn/gifti (clone into this folder)
  - matlab
  - hippunfold with uniform template run on a set of subjects
    - here we used HCP UR100, and hippunfold v0.5.1
    - it uses this to create an average surface area (gyrification) map
